jGridstart
----------

jGridstart is a graphical user interface in Java that helps grid end-users
to request, obtain, install and renew grid certificates in a friendly way.

Grid certificate authorities (who issue certificates) can use it to provide
a friendly interface to its services. It is currently tailored for the
DutchGrid certificate authority, but the plan is to make it more general.

For more information, please visit  http://jgridstart.nikhef.nl/


Adapting jGridstart for a new certificate authority requires:

1. Modifying the configuration in resources/conf/global.properties
     See comments in the file.

2. Selection of a CA interface
     The nl.nikhef.jgridstart.ca package contains the interface CA, which
     provides an interface between jGridstart and the CA. The specific
     implementation used is specified in the global configuration file.
     You probably need to write one tailored to your CA interface. Please
     see DutchGridCA, TestCA and LocalCA for examples. Please send us your
     implementation so we can add it to jGridstart.

3. Customization of the request wizard
     The RequestWizard (in package nl.nikhef.jgridstart.gui) contains the
     user-interface logic for requesting/renew certificates. The contents
     of the wizard's pages are present in the files requestwizard-xx.html.
     Currently, one would need to rewrite RequestWizard for your specific
     request process. In the future this should become more easily
     customizable.

4. Specification of organisations for which one can signup
    In resources/conf/cert_signup.conf, see comments in that file.
    At the moment one also needs to update CertificateRequest#postFillData
    (in package nl.nikhef.jgridstart) and specify how to create a full
    DN from user information. This is scheduled for improvement as well.
