Interface to web browsers installed on the system. This allows one to open an
URL in a web browser, and install certificates and keys into their
certificate stores.
<p>
Each platform ({@link BrowsersWindows Windows}, {@link BrowsersMacOSX Mac OS X}
and {@link BrowsersUnix Unix/Linux}) has its own method of running the web
browsers, of detecting which browsers are installed, and of discovering which
is the system default. All platforms share a list of known browsers, however,
which is defined in {@code browsers.properties}. Generally, only these
browsers can be invoked.
<p>
For client-side SSL authentication, it may be needed to install a certificate
and corresponding private key into the browser. This is done by the method
{@link IBrowsers#installPKCS12}, which expects a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PKCS12">PKCS#12</a> file to import from.
After this, you can use {@link IBrowsers#openUrl} to open a HTTPS page.
