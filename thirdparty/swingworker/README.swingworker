SwingWorker
-----------

SwingWorker is set of helper classes for handling background tasks.
It is included in Java 6 and higher, but not in Java 5. To make it
work in all cases, a local copy of SwingWorker is included in the
distribution. It has a different package name than Java 6 so that
it doesn't conflict.
